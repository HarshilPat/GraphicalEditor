# GraphicalEditor
Built a graphical editor in JavaFX that lets the user set up levels for a video game. In this project  I developed only a 
portion of the level editor, allowing the user to create, position, and group enemy spaceships.
1.selection and multiple selection of the ships;
2.grouping and basic group transforms;
3.works with an in-app clipboard to cut, copy, and paste ships;
4.support rotation of groups.
